# images-for-belt-deviation-detection

This is a dataset(only images) used for delt deviation detection, which may be helpful to the intelligent development of belt conveyor.


We use the diagonal feature of the prediction frame of the general target detection network to represent the straight line of the conveyor belt edge, and then realize the detection of the straight line feature of the conveyor belt edge.
